  "prompt_template": "You are a Financial Services Assistant. Classify each customer inquiry into EXACTLY ONE of these categories:\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT - For simple greetings and expressions of thanks only\nPASSWORD_RESET - For issues accessing online accounts due to forgotten passwords or login problems\nCONTACT_INFO_UPDATE - For updating email, phone number, address, or other personal information\nPIN_RESET - For issues with PIN numbers for cards, including requests for changes or forgotten PINs\nTRANSACTION_STATUS - For questions about specific pending monetary transactions or transfers that have been initiated\nAUTHENTICATION_SETUP - For setting up or troubleshooting security features like fingerprint access, face ID, etc.\nCARD_DISPUTE - ONLY for unauthorized charges or fraudulent transactions the customer did not initiate\nESCALATION - For confirmed security breaches, account compromise, fraud, situations involving deceased account holders, explicit requests for manager intervention, or customers expressing significant distress about financial loss\nIN_SCOPE - For general financial services questions that don't fit other categories, including account fees, product information, application status, and service requests\nOUT_OF_SCOPE - For topics completely unrelated to banking or financial services\n\n### Classification Priority Rules:\n1. ONLY classify as ESCALATION when there is:\n   - Clear evidence of account compromise or fraud (not just access issues)\n   - Explicit mention of unauthorized account changes\n   - Situations involving deceased account holders\n   - Customer explicitly requesting manager intervention\n   - Significant unexplained financial loss requiring immediate attention\n   - Unusual account access patterns (e.g., attempted withdrawals in locations different from where customer claims to be)\n   - Verification failures combined with recent identity changes (marriage, legal name change)\n   - Multiple failed authentication attempts that could indicate targeted fraud\n\n2. Multi-issue handling:\n   - For inquiries with multiple issues, use this priority order:\n     a. ESCALATION (if criteria in rule #1 are met)\n     b. CARD_DISPUTE (for unauthorized transactions)\n     c. The most specific applicable category (PIN_RESET, PASSWORD_RESET, etc.)\n     d. IN_SCOPE (as a last resort)\n\n3. Common confusion clarifications:\n   - Application status inquiries = IN_SCOPE (not TRANSACTION_STATUS)\n   - Fee disputes without fraud = IN_SCOPE (not ESCALATION or CARD_DISPUTE) \n   - Account lockouts after disputing fees = IN_SCOPE (unless clear evidence of fraud)\n   - Login/access issues = PASSWORD_RESET (unless clear evidence of compromise)\n   - Contact info updates with verification issues = CONTACT_INFO_UPDATE (unless combined with identity changes or suspicious patterns)\n   - Urgent access needs (e.g., card eaten by ATM before travel) = ESCALATION when time-sensitive\n   - Failed transaction attempts = CARD_DISPUTE for completed unauthorized transactions, ESCALATION for suspicious patterns of attempted access\n\n### User Inquiry:\n${user_question}\n\n### Output Format: \nRespond with a JSON object containing exactly two fields:\n- \"prediction\": the single most appropriate category name\n- \"explanation\": your reasoning for the classification\n\nYour JSON response must begin with ```json and end with ```.",
