## Feedback is important for improving the performance of LLM

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, they can sometimes struggle with complex or ambiguous inputs. This is where feedback mechanisms become essential. By incorporating feedback loops, LLMs can learn from their mistakes, refine the instruction, and adapt to challenging scenarios.

One powerful approach is critiquing, where LLMs are paired with external feedback mechanism that provide critiques or feedbacks. For instance, when processing documents, if an LLM generates an incorrect summary, a fact-checking tool can identify inaccuracies and provide feedback. The model can then revise its output, leading to improved accuracy and reliability. This iterative process mirrors human learning, where feedback drives continuous improvement.


These feedback mechanisms prove especially crucial in document processing scenarios demanding high accuracy. Take handwritten documents as an example - LLMs often grapple with challenges like inconsistent handwriting styles, smudged text, or unconventional layouts. By integrating feedback loops from OCR tools and human reviewers, the system can progressively refine its interpretation capabilities, leading to increasingly accurate results. This evolutionary approach transforms LLMs from static, single-pass generators into dynamic systems capable of continuous improvement through iterative refinement. For deeper insights into these mechanisms, we recommend exploring two key research papers: [CRITIC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11738), which demonstrates how LLMs can self-correct with tool-interactive critiquing, and [Reflexion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366), which explores language agents with verbal reinforcement learning. The figure below provides a visual representation of this feedback process.

In the next section, we'll explore how these feedback mechanisms can be operationalized to enhance workflows.
